# DHCP-Pool-Configuration-Cisco-Packet-Tracer



<h2>Description</h2>
This repository documents the configuration of a DHCP (Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol) pool on Cisco Packet Tracer, accomplished exclusively through the Command Line Interface (CLI). The project focuses on setting up a dynamic addressing environment to efficiently allocate IP addresses to devices within a network.
<br />


<h2>Features</h2>

- <b>CLI Configuration: The entire DHCP pool setup is achieved using the Cisco Packet Tracer Command Line Interface, providing a hands-on experience in configuring networking devices.

- IP Address Management: Learn how to define and manage an IP address pool, ensuring dynamic allocation of addresses to devices within the network.

- Scalability: Explore techniques for scaling the DHCP configuration to accommodate a growing number of devices, with an emphasis on optimizing resource utilization.</b>

- Ping: Is a network utility tool used to test the reachability of a host (computer or server) on an Internet Protocol (IP) network. It also measures the round-trip time for messages sent from the originating host to a destination computer and back


<h2>Environments Used </h2>
